### Drug Overhaul 

The drug system has had a full overhaul, you now have progression levels that earn you more money and unlock new drugs the higher level you go. This change has also added in the ability to use LSD which gives you a hard trip but rewards you with over health for some time. 

### Gas Masks 

You can now craft gas masks to help prevent BZ gas damage from collecting various items.  

### Map Updates 

We have seen a lot of locations come and go recently but some notable changes have been the new Legion Square, Benny's Mechanics, LSC Mechanics, and the introduction of many rentable billboard locations around the city. 

### Vehicles 

Huge changes have been seen in the vehicle scene, including wraps, the RGB phone app, Tyre repair kits, countless hours spent making sure cars handle how they should, and an ever-growing catalog of new vehicles being added. 

### Animations 

The ever-growing list of new animations is being brought to the city to enhance our RP experience. 

### Vendor Wars 

A full new vendor claiming system has been implemented to shape how the Syndicated claiming system works bringing a new touch to the ever-growing gang scene. 

### FDG Racing Pre-Release 

The FDG racing telemetry app was released in public beta earlier this year. The app aims to collect telemetry from laps performed on pre-set tracks for use in the balancing and configuration of new vehicles. Accessible via https://racing.fatduckgaming.com, the app allows participants to view track records and visualize telemetry data.
