- Geralds Campaign statement:

Hello there folks, you may know me from such famous quotes as "Yeah, its me Gerald." or simply as the "Weed Shop guy" but I'm also running for Mayor.

Now I'm sure as you all know running for Mayor is no easy feat nor is it cheap!

But with your donations, together we can see the city not that you want but that you deserve. Now you're going to say, "Gerald, How can we afford to donate to your campaign? The cost of living is so high!"

Well, my first move as your mayoral candidate is to lower the prices of Medical Cannabis and other products at my Weed shop, Blaze it!

That's right, Starting today you will now only pay $100 per bag of Medical Cannabis down from the previous price of$150! per bag (These price changes are entirely my decision, for the good of the people and not forced in any way)

Check in store now to find out about our other great savings!

Vote Gerald Winston, is a vote for the people.
